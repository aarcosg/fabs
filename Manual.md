To generate detailed documentation for a SQL model, we need specific information about the query and its context. However, I can guide you on how to structure your documentation based on typical elements involved in SQL modeling. Since "Prueba 3" doesn't provide any code or specifics, I'll give you a template you can fill out with your actual data model details.

### Documentation Template for SQL Model

#### 1. Data Source Tables
- **Table Names:** List all tables that the query uses as its source.
- **Description:** Provide a brief description of each table and its relevance to the model.
- **Example:**
  - `players`: Contains information about game players, including player ID, name, registration date, etc.
  - `game_sessions`: Logs each session played by players, including session ID, player ID, start time, end time, etc.

#### 2. Primary and Unique Keys
- **Primary Key:** Specify the primary key for each source table involved in the query.
- **Unique Keys:** Identify any unique constraints on columns that ensure data integrity.
- **Example:**
  - `players`: Primary Key - `player_id`
  - `game_sessions`: Primary Key - `session_id`; Unique Key - (`player_id`, `start_time`) to prevent duplicate sessions for the same player at the same time.

#### 3. Schema Resulting from the Query (Query Output)
- **Column Names:** List all columns that appear in the output of the query.
- **Data Types:** Specify the data type for each column.
- **Example:**
  - `player_id` (INT)
  - `total_sessions` (INT)
  - `average_session_duration` (FLOAT)

#### 4. Data Aggregation Level
- Describe how data is aggregated in the query.
- Indicate whether the aggregation is at a player level, session level, or another granularity.
- **Example:**
  - The model aggregates data at the player level, summarizing total sessions and average duration per player.

#### 5. Summary of the Model Logic
- Provide a concise explanation of what the query accomplishes.
- Highlight any joins, filters, groupings, or calculations performed.
- **Example:**
  - This model calculates each player's total number of game sessions and their average session duration by joining `players` with `game_sessions` on `player_id`, filtering out incomplete sessions, grouping results by `player_id`, and performing aggregation functions.

#### Points of Improvement or Bugs
- Identify any potential issues in the data model.
- Suggest improvements for performance, readability, or accuracy.
- **Example:**
  - **Improvement:** Consider indexing `player_id` on `game_sessions` to improve join performance.
  - **Bug:** Ensure that session duration calculations handle edge cases like sessions starting and ending at the same time.

### Example Documentation Filled Out

#### Data Source Tables
- `players`: Contains player information, including `player_id`, name, and registration date.
- `game_sessions`: Logs game sessions with `session_id`, `player_id`, start and end times.

#### Primary and Unique Keys
- `players`: Primary Key - `player_id`
- `game_sessions`: Primary Key - `session_id`; Unique Key - (`player_id`, `start_time`)

#### Schema Resulting from the Query (Query Output)
- `player_id` (INT)
- `total_sessions` (INT)
- `average_session_duration` (FLOAT)

#### Data Aggregation Level
- The model aggregates data at the player level, summarizing session metrics per player.

#### Summary of the Model Logic
- Joins `players` and `game_sessions` on `player_id`, filters out sessions without an end time, groups by `player_id`, and calculates total sessions and average duration.

#### Points of Improvement or Bugs
- **Improvement:** Index `player_id` in `game_sessions` for faster joins.
- **Bug:** Check for zero-duration sessions to avoid skewing average calculations.

This template should help you document your SQL models effectively. Adjust the sections based on the specific details and requirements of "Prueba 3."
